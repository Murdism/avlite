"""AVLite canonical sensor formats.

All WorldBridge implementations must populate SensorFrame using these exact
layouts. Convert simulator/ROS messages in the bridge; do not pass raw
message layouts to perception or localization.

``Camera`` and ``Lidar`` are sensor-state snapshots: each contains its device
identity, mount, calibration (where applicable), acquisition time, and reading.
``SensorFrame.cameras`` and ``SensorFrame.lidars`` hold all devices by name;
``frame.camera`` and ``frame.lidar`` refer to the explicitly selected primary
objects in those collections. There is no separate storage for extra devices.

Reading layouts
---------------
Camera.rgb     (H, W, 3) uint8, row-major RGB
Camera.depth   (H, W) float32, metres
Lidar.points   (N, 4) float32, [x, y, z, intensity] in the lidar's coordinate frame
imu            Imu — linear accel + angular velocity in the IMU's coordinate frame
gnss           Gnss — WGS84 lat/lon/alt + optional map x/y/z
wheel_odometry WheelOdometry — linear_velocity m/s + yaw_rate rad/s (body frame)

IMU, GNSS, and wheel odometry are single Sensor-derived snapshots on the frame.
Each owns its identity, mount, timestamp, and reading fields; there are no
separate IMU/GNSS mount objects or collections. Their frame entries are None
when unavailable or disabled.

Bridges must create a fresh sensor-state object for each acquisition, rather
than mutate an object retained by an earlier frame. ``dataclasses.replace``
can reuse device metadata while attaching a new reading and ``stamp``. It is
a shallow copy: do not mutate shared calibration or reading buffers; copy
buffers if the driver reuses them. A missing camera/lidar reading is ``None``
on the sensor, not a reason to remove it or select a different primary.

Coordinate frames
-----------------
Every ``Sensor`` carries one static mount, ``base_to_sensor``: the pose of the
device in the ego body frame, so ``p_body = base_to_sensor @ p_sensor``. The
body frame has its origin at ``State.x/y/z``, +x along the heading, z up.
Bridges never bake the ego pose into measurements; the stack composes
sensor → body → map from its own pose estimate with
``Sensor.to_map(points, state)``, which uses ``State.pose_matrix()``. That is
what keeps localization independent of the bridge.
